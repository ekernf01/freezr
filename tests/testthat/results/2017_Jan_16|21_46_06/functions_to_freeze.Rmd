This is a file with a function in it. The function's output depends on `dependency.txt` and the function gets used in `script_to_freeze.R`.

```{r}
print_dependency_contents = function( ){
  print( "FREEZR_DESTINATION" )
  print( FREEZR_DESTINATION )
  print( "FREEZR_DESTINATION")
  print( readLines( "dependency.txt" ))
  write.table(rnorm(5), file.path( FREEZR_DESTINATION, "demo_output.txt" ) )
  hist( rnorm(50), main = "I'm a histogram!" )
}
```
