Title: Easily Archive Quickly Changing Custom R Scripts For Reproducible Analysis
Version: 0.1.0

Description: If you are a data analyst in a scientific or scholarly field, then you've likely 
    experienced the tension between reproducibility demands and fast-changing custom analysis scripts. 
    `freezr` is an `R` package meant to alleviate this tension. It helps you archive your current 
    analysis in a snap so you can move on to the next question or approach. In a single line of code, 
    it will run your script, gather the output into a time-stamped results folder, save a copy of your 
    code and `sessionInfo()`** along with the results, and nag you to write down some notes** about what
    you did. For bigger projects, `freezr` includes a simple "inventory" system to keep track of saved
    data. This allows you to load data into a downstream script without hard-coding paths, which is 
    particularly useful when saving intermediates inside of timestamped `freezr` archives.
